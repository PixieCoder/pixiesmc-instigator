# Pixie'S MC Instigator

## What is this?
It's the admin console half of Pixie Coder's static site builder (Pixie'S MC)

## How do I use it?
* Sign up with Graph.cool
* Copy `secrets.tpl.json` to `secrets.json` and fill it with real keys.
* Build it.
* Copy the files to a good location (could be local or server side).
* Install the generator to a server and make it periodically regenerate the
 site (every 15 minutes works for me).
